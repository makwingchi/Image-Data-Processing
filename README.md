# Image-Data-Processing

### Description
In this analysis, we will focus on two main aspects:
1. Image processing and convolutional computations;
2. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms to compress image data

### Required Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
- `tqdm`

### Result
The analyses are presented in the [Image_and_Convolution](https://github.com/makwingchi/Image-Data-Processing/blob/master/Image_and_Convolution.ipynb), and [Image_Data_Compression](https://github.com/makwingchi/Image-Data-Processing/blob/master/Image_Data_Compression.ipynb) notebooks, respectively.
